## 🌟 Features  

### 1️⃣ Random Number Guessing Game 🎲  
- The computer generates a **random number between 1 and 100**.  
- The user has **5 attempts** to guess the number.  
- Hints such as "higher" or "lower" are provided for each guess.  
- If the user guesses correctly, they are congratulated 🎉; otherwise, the correct number is revealed.  

### 2️⃣ Calculator 🧮  
- Perform four basic mathematical operations:  
  - Addition ➕  
  - Subtraction ➖  
  - Multiplication ✖️  
  - Division ➗  
- The user enters two numbers and selects the operation to perform.  
- The result is displayed instantly.  
- Division by zero is handled properly with an error message.  

### 3️⃣ Average Grade Calculator 📊  
- The user enters three grades (**between 0 and 100**).  
- The program calculates the average and assigns a letter grade:  
  - **AA** for 90-100  
  - **FF** for 0-54, and others accordingly!  
- The program validates the input to ensure it is within the correct range.
